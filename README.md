# rzauls.github.io (rzauls.com)
Personal website

Currently under construction

Possible plans:
 * convert into a single markdown file instead of an actual website, since there are currently no concrete plans to make this a fancy portfolio
 * ~write a markdown-to-html converter, that creates a blog post from uploading a markdown file to a remote server. Plug that engine under a React (or any other front-end framework) powered navigation site with an about page and a project page -> website done~
 * turns out the markdown-to-html converter already exists AND its React based. Onwards with Gatsby!
 
 Current plan:
  Rewrite the site with Gatsby, with all content pages as seperate markdown files for easy editing later.
