# rzauls.github.io (rzauls.com)
Personal website

Currently under construction

Possible plans:
 * convert into a single markdown file instead of an actual website, since there are currently no concrete plans to make this a fancy portfolio
 * write a markdown-to-html converter, that creates a blog post from uploading a markdown file to a remote server. Plug that engine under a React (or any other front-end framework) powered navigation site with an about page and a project page -> website done
 
 Have not decided what direction im going to take (13.01.19).
